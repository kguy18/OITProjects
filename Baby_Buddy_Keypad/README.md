I made a quick little keypad for adding data to baby buddy through the (BabyBuddy Home Assistant Integration)[link] through a NodeMCU with (ESPHome)[link]

Its a simple 8 switch keypad. In my use case its used for 3 different lighting scenes (bright, medium, nightlight) and four baby buddy data points (solid diaper, wet diaper, start sleep, end sleep).
