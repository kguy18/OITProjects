__MQTT Notification Board__

This is an MQTT notification board for use with Home Assistant (or whatever else). I use it to monitor my aquarium stats from Home Assistant and Reef-Pi. It can be motion activated with a PIR sensor or triggered to display a light if there is an importnt change (error, etc).
